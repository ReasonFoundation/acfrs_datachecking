# Example of 63 School Districts

This is a hand-matched example of 63 school district in NCES data & ACFRs. (Thank you! Marc)

Analyzing the pattern of match between these 2 datasets will help to construct better match in the full datasets. 

```{r}
example_match_60sd <- rio::import(here::here("data", "Mappings for Largest School Districts (2).xlsx")) %>% 
  rename(acfrs_name = `Name in ACFR System`, 
         nces_name = `District Name`) %>% 
  select(acfrs_name, nces_name, `State District ID`, `State...7`) 

example_match_60sd_clean <- example_match_60sd %>% 
   mutate(nces_name = str_to_lower(nces_name),
         acfrs_name = str_to_lower(acfrs_name)) %>% 
  
  # remove terms in acfrs, 1st time
  mutate(acfrs_name = str_remove_all(acfrs_name, "(the)?\\s*school district\\s*(of)?|county|independent school district|district school board|\\s*board of education\\s* (of the)?|public schools|the school board of|board of education|public school system")) %>% 

  # remove terms in acfrs, second time
